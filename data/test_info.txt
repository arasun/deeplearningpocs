Detailed Information

The follow list gives the films in the MIAS database and provides appropriate details as follows:

1st column:
MIAS database reference number.
2nd column:
Character of background tissue:
  F  Fatty
  G  Fatty-glandular
  D  Dense-glandular

3rd column:
Class of abnormality present:
  CALC  Calcification
  CIRC  Well-defined/circumscribed masses
  SPIC  Spiculated masses
  MISC  Other, ill-defined masses
  ARCH  Architectural distortion
  ASYM  Asymmetry
  NORM  Normal

4th column:
Severity of abnormality;
  B  Benign
  M  Malignant

5th, 6th columns:
x,y image-coordinates of centre of abnormality.
7th column:
Approximate radius (in pixels) of a circle enclosing the abnormality.
There are also several things you should note:

The list is arranged in pairs of films, where each pair represents the left (even filename numbers) and right mammograms (odd filename numbers) of a single patient.
The size of all the images is 1024 pixels x 1024 pixels. The images have been centered in the matrix.
When calcifications are present, centre locations and radii apply to clusters rather than individual calcifications. Coordinate system origin is the bottom-left corner.
In some cases calcifications are widely distributed throughout the image rather than concentrated at a single site. In these cases centre locations and radii are inappropriate and have been omitted.
